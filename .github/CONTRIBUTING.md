## Commit messages

You must follow the
[commit message convention](https://conventionalcommits.org/) to enable
automatic changelog generation. If you aren't familiar with the convention, use
`npm run commit` instead of `git commit` to provide an interactive CLI for
generating valid commit messages.

## Tests

- Write a test for each use case.
- Try to stick to one assertion per use case.
- Too thorough is better than not thorough enough.
